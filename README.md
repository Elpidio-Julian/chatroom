# Chat Application Using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)


## Separate Client/Server Approach
 I plan to use a separate application as the server for the client

Broad Requirements:
>Client Demands:
 >1. ability to send and receive messages
 >2. Will need to display a chat window with a text input box
 >6. live message feedback
 >5. private messaging
 >3. options for room joining/leaving
 >4. Keep track of rooms for user

>Server Demands:
 >1. ability to receive and send messages
 >2. Needs to be CORS enabled

## Client Approach
